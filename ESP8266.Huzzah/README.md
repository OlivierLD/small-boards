The ESP8266/Huzzah is programmable with the Arduino IDE, and it has WiFi capabilities.
As such, it can connect to a Network (LAN or Internet, whatever).

### Examples provided here
- `huzzah.blink.test`: 101, just blink a led.
- `huzzah.web.client`: Web client 101, the basics.
- `huzzah.web.2.client`: Web client sending a REST request, and parsing the result. Output is sent to the Serial console.
- `huzzah.smart.TCP.watch`: Same as above, with an OLED display to see the result.
