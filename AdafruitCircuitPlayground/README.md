# Adafruit Circuit Playground
- Doc [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express?view=all)
- Recent versions of Mac OS will not see this board (ah crap!)
- No problem from a Raspberry Pi
    - But Mu (python editor) has problems running on Rasbpian-Buster...
      - Sep 2020: Last version of RasPi OS fixed it.
- No problem running the Arduino IDE for the Circuit Playground on Rasbpian-Buster.
  - See [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express?view=all#arduino) to install the required libs
  - The required libs comes with many examples (`File` > `Examples` > `Adafruit Circuit Playground`)
  - Way to go!
