# Adafruit Circuit Playground
- Recent versions of Mac OS will not see this board (ah crap!)
- No problem from a Raspberry Pi
    - But Mu (python editor) has problems running on Rasbpian-Buster...
- No problem running the Arduino IDE for the Circuit Playground on Rasbpian-Buster.
    - The required libs comes with many examples (`File` > `Examples` > `Adafruit Circuit Playground`)
    - Way to go!
